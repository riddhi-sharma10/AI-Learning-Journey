# AI Learning Journey (Project-Based)

This repository documents my **project-first AI learning journey**, where I learn Artificial Intelligence concepts by **building real projects instead of studying isolated theory**. Each day focuses on one hands-on project that introduces core AI, ML, and NLP concepts incrementally.

The goal is to become **AI/ML internship-ready** by developing strong fundamentals, practical implementation skills, and the ability to explain *how* and *why* systems work.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand **rule-based AI and decision-making systems**
* Build strong **Python foundations for AI/ML**
* Learn **Machine Learning concepts through implementation**
* Gain hands-on experience with **data preprocessing, models, and evaluation**
* Explore **NLP and basic Deep Learning**
* Create a **resume-ready AI project portfolio**
